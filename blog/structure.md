**Blog Post Skeleton**

**I. Introduction: The Quest for Career Clarity**
    *   The challenge: Navigating the job market, understanding required skills, and identifying true opportunities.
    *   The traditional approach vs. data-driven insights.
    *   Our goal: Leverage LLMs to distill actionable career guidance from LinkedIn job listings.
    *   Introducing the star: A fine-tuned Qwen3.0 8B (distilled from Gemini-2.0-flash) for structured information extraction.
    *   High-level overview of the project: Data Pipeline -> Data Transformation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Insight Generation.

**II. Building the Foundation: The Data Pipeline**
    *   **A. Overview: From LinkedIn to Labeled Data**
        *   Goal: Reliably and automatically gather, process, and store LinkedIn job listings.
        *   Key components: Web scraping, cloud storage, data warehousing, and workflow orchestration.
        *   Tech stack highlights: Python, Selenium, GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), BigQuery, Dataform.

    *   **B. Phase 1: Scraping and Initial Storage (GitHub Actions Workflow 1: "Scrape and Parse to GCS")**
        *   **Workflow Trigger:** Scheduled daily (`cron: '0 6 * * *'`) and manual dispatch.
        *   **Core Logic & Key Steps:**
            1.  **Environment Setup:**
                *   `ubuntu-latest` runner.
                *   Python 3.10.6.
                *   **Crucial: Google Chrome Installation.** (Discuss why this is needed â€“ likely for Selenium-based scraping).
            2.  **Dependency Management:**
                *   Separate `requirements.txt` for scraper, parser, and GCS/BQ sink components. (Good practice for modularity).
            3.  **Secrets Management:**
                *   Securely creating `.env` file from GitHub Secrets. (Emphasize security and the types of secrets: GCP credentials, LinkedIn credentials, API keys, Prefect config, etc.).
            4.  **LinkedIn Scraping (`src/events/linkedin_scraper/main.py`):**
                *   **Topics to discuss:**
                    *   Using Selenium with Chrome.
                    *   Handling LinkedIn login (email, password, `li_at` cookie).
                    *   Search parameters (`SEARCH_KEYWORDS`, `LOCATION`).
                    *   Pagination (`MAX_PAGES_TO_SCRAPE`).
                    *   Navigating dynamic content (scrolling, delays: `PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT`, `INTERACTION_DELAY`, `SCROLL_PAUSES_WITHIN_PAGE`, `DELAY_BETWEEN_SCROLLS`).
                    *   Outputting raw scraped data (HTML, or pre-parsed JSON/CSVs) to a local `OUTPUT_DIR`.
                    *   Implicit: Uploading from `OUTPUT_DIR` to GCS (though `gcs_to_bq.py` is run next, the workflow name implies data lands in GCS first, which is good).
            5.  **Initial Parsing & GCS Upload (Conceptual - `src/events/parse_to_gcs/requirements.txt` suggests this intent):**
                *   **Topics to discuss:**
                    *   Even if not explicitly run as a separate script in the YAML, discuss the *need* for parsing raw scraped data.
                    *   Extracting key fields: Job Title, Company, Location, Job Description text, Post URL, etc.
                    *   Saving structured data (e.g., JSONL or Parquet) to Google Cloud Storage (`GCS_BUCKET_NAME`, `GCS_SUBFOLDER_PATH`).
                    *   Why GCS: Scalable, cost-effective staging area.
            6.  **Loading to Data Warehouse (`src/events/gcs_to_bg_sink/gcs_to_bq.py`):**
                *   **Topics to discuss:**
                    *   Taking parsed data from GCS and loading it into BigQuery.
                    *   BigQuery as the analytical data warehouse.
                    *   Schema definition and management (`BQ_WRITE_DISPOSITION`, `BQ_CREATE_DISPOSITION`, `BQ_SCHEMA_UPDATE_OPTIONS`).
                    *   Batch vs. streaming (likely batch here).

    *   **C. Phase 2: Data Cleansing and Normalization with Dataform**
        *   **Purpose:** Ensure data consistency and quality within BigQuery before it's used for fine-tuning.
        *   **Key Transformations (as mentioned):**
            *   Normalizing technology names (e.g., "python", "Python3", "python 3.x" -> "python").
            *   Downcasing text.
            *   Removing extra spaces and special characters.
            *   Standardizing date formats, locations, etc.
        *   **Why Dataform:**
            *   SQL-based data transformation.
            *   Version control for transformations.
            *   Testing and dependency management for data models.
            *   Creating clean, analytics-ready tables.

    *   **D. Orchestration and Monitoring (Briefly mention)**
        *   GitHub Actions for CI/CD and scheduling.
        *   Prefect (implied by `PREFECT_API_KEY` etc.): Discuss its potential role in more complex workflow orchestration, monitoring, and error handling beyond basic GitHub Actions capabilities.

**III. Fine-Tuning Qwen3.0 8B: Extracting Structured Insights**
    *   **A. The Goal: From Job Description to Actionable JSON**
        *   Why fine-tuning? To teach the model our specific task: extracting predefined entities and classifying aspects of a job listing.
        *   The target output: A structured JSON object per job listing. (Show an example based on your `PROMPT_FORMAT_STRING`).

    *   **B. Model and Tools Selection**
        *   **Model:** Qwen3.0 8B (distilled from Gemini-2.0-flash) - Discuss why this model (size, capabilities, instruction-following).
        *   **Unsloth:** Highlight its benefits (2x faster fine-tuning, memory optimization). Mention the importance of importing it first.
        *   **Hugging Face Ecosystem:** `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft` (for LoRA), `trl` (for `SFTTrainer`).
        *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Explain why it's used (efficient fine-tuning, reduced computational resources).

    *   **C. The Fine-Tuning Workflow (Based on your notebook cells):**
        1.  **Setup & Imports (Cell 0):**
            *   Standard libraries.
            *   Key ML libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, `trl`, `unsloth`.
        2.  **Loading the Foundational Model and Tokenizer (Cell 3):**
            *   `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained` from Unsloth.
            *   Model: `unsloth/qwen2-0.5b-instruct` (Note: Title says Qwen3.0 8B, code says qwen2-0.5b. Clarify or use the title's model for the blog post narrative, explaining this snippet is illustrative for a smaller variant if needed).
            *   Parameters: `max_seq_length`, `dtype`, `load_in_4bit` (4-bit quantization for memory saving).
            *   Applying LoRA configuration: `LoraConfig` (target modules, `r`, `lora_alpha`, `lora_dropout`, `bias`).
        3.  **Data Preparation for Fine-Tuning:**
            *   **Fetching Data from BigQuery (Cell 4):**
                *   Using a custom `bq_connector`.
                *   Querying the cleaned/normalized data from Dataform's output tables.
                *   Incremental loading concept (`latest_date_filter`).
            *   **Crafting the Instruction-Following Dataset (Cell 5):**
                *   **The `PROMPT_FORMAT_STRING`:** This is CRITICAL. Show it. Explain how it structures the input to the LLM (system message, instruction, job description) and defines the expected JSON output format.
                *   The `create_target_json` function: Explain its role in taking raw job data (e.g., job description text) and formatting it into the prompt.
                *   Converting Pandas DataFrame to Hugging Face `Dataset`.
                *   **Tokenization:** Mapping the formatting function to the dataset using `tokenizer`.
            *   **Data Filtering (Cell 6):**
                *   Removing examples with empty inputs or outputs post-tokenization to ensure training quality.
        4.  **Configuring and Running the Training (Cell 7):**
            *   `TrainingArguments`:
                *   Key parameters: `per_device_train_batch_size`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, `warmup_steps`, `num_train_epochs`, `learning_rate`, `fp16`/`bf16`, `logging_steps`, `optim`, `output_dir`, `seed`. Explain a few important ones.
            *   `SFTTrainer` (Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer):
                *   Passing the model, tokenizer, training dataset, PEFT config, max sequence length, and training arguments.
                *   The `dataset_text_field` or a `formatting_func_for_sft` (if not handled earlier).
            *   Initiating training: `trainer.train()`.
            *   Monitoring: Loss curves, evaluation metrics (if applicable).
        5.  **Saving the Fine-Tuned Model (Cell 8):**
            *   Saving LoRA adapters: `model.save_pretrained("qwen_job_extractor_lora")`.
            *   Optional: Merging adapters with the base model for deployment and saving the full model. `model.merge_and_unload()` followed by `save_pretrained`.

**IV. Preliminary Results & Next Steps (Placeholder - To be filled by you)**
    *   Show an example of a raw job description and the structured JSON output from your fine-tuned model.
    *   Discuss initial observations: How well does it extract skills, benefits, responsibilities?
    *   Challenges encountered during fine-tuning (e.g., prompt engineering, data quality issues, hyperparameter tuning).
    *   Future plans:
        *   Rigorous evaluation.
        *   Deployment as an API.
        *   Building a front-end for users to get insights.
